# Instagram-Follower-Analysis
Collected data from Instagram about user attributes like existing followers of the user, total posts, comments, likes, etc to predict if the user will follow you back when you are following the user from a neutral account (neutral account is where you donâ€™t reveal personal information about yourself like age, gender etc. You only have a bio, dp and some posts).
